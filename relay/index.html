    ![Tesla Stock] I&rsquo;ve said the investors are missing the forest for the trees by getting pissy about it. Anyone who&rsquo;s watched Musk over the years has seen he has a larger vision in mind, and the Solar City acquisition positions Tesla closer to that goal than ever before. If only I&rsquo;d put my money where my mouth is&hellip; I expect we&rsquo;ll see news of a larger charging station rollout, a bigger push into residential solar/battery installations, Solar City&rsquo;s role in both of those, and perhaps an update on the Gigafactory and its ability to transform the already quickly changing battery market.  <a href="/relay/2017-04-04_elon-musk-gloating-dissing-haters/">Read More...</a>

    In response to the missing EgyptAir plane, Capt John Cox explains that lithium batteries pose an increasing risk for airlines. Estimates show that aboard a plane of 100 passengers, there could be over 500 lithium batteries stowed away in the cabin. While unlikely, these lithium batteries could potentially cause a fire if they were to become punctured or otherwise damaged. One of the millions of reasons we desperately need solid state battery tech.  <a href="/relay/2016-05-23_lithium-is-one-helluva-drug-err-firestarter/">Read More...</a>

    The internet freedom trolls at the pirate bay have managed to close the loop in their border hopping fight to keep their tracker alive by once again returning to a temporary safe haven at thepiratebay.org, the domain their story started at. To recap, this adventure started in 2012 when the Pirate Bay switched from .org to .se under threat of seizure by US law enforcement, which was followed by successive leaps to .gl, .is, .sx, .ac, .pe, .gy, and back to .se.  <a href="/relay/2016-05-22_the-tracker-formerly-known-as-piratebay/">Read More...</a>

Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis made clear that the US does &ldquo;not collaborate or coordinate with the Russians on any operations in Syria&rdquo;, going on to point out Russia&rsquo;s support of Assad. In the end, nothing changes. Syria&rsquo;s still rekt and remains the backdrop of a proxy war. story: Yahoo News
