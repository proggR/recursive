      <title>Elon Musk Is Gloating Over Higher Than Expected Shipment Numbers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;![Tesla Stock]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve said the investors are missing the forest for the trees by getting pissy about it. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watched Musk over the years has seen he has a larger vision in mind, and the Solar City acquisition positions Tesla closer to that goal than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only I&amp;rsquo;d put my money where my mouth is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect we&amp;rsquo;ll see news of a larger charging station rollout, a bigger push into residential solar/battery installations, Solar City&amp;rsquo;s role in both of those, and perhaps an update on the Gigafactory and its ability to transform the already quickly changing battery market. Put together, Tesla would be positioned to play an incredibly powerful role in the transition to a green energy grid through a decentralized energy production and distribution system that relies heavily on energy arbitrage. The real clincher would be if stronger state partnerships have been worked out and an announcement of Tesla pursuing closer relationships with more states as a way to secure tax credits for consumers adopting Tesla/other green energy tech that fits with this model. Investors only ever see the short term dollars and cents after all, but I suspect the master plan will be grand indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a fair chunk of that right too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that. I&amp;rsquo;m back. For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elon Musk Top Secret Tesla Plan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After catching flak for wanting to buy Solar City with Tesla money, Elon Musk claims to have a top secret Tesla master plan he hopes to release soon. Since news broke up the Solar City acquisition and the investor blowback, I&amp;rsquo;ve said the investors are missing the forest for the trees by getting pissy about it. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watched Musk over the years has seen he has a larger vision in mind, and the Solar City acquisition positions Tesla closer to that goal than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lithium Is One Helluva Drug... Err... Fire Starter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the missing EgyptAir plane, Capt John Cox explains that lithium batteries pose an increasing risk for airlines. Estimates show that aboard a plane of 100 passengers, there could be over 500 lithium batteries stowed away in the cabin. While unlikely, these lithium batteries could potentially cause a fire if they were to become punctured or otherwise damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the millions of reasons we desperately need solid state battery tech.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tracker Formerly Known AS thepiratebay.org Is Once Again thepiratebay.org</title>
      <link>http://recursivew.it/relay/2016-05-22_the-tracker-formerly-known-as-piratebay/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet freedom trolls at the pirate bay have managed to close the loop in their border hopping fight to keep their tracker alive by once again returning to a temporary safe haven at thepiratebay.org, the domain their story started at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, this adventure started in 2012 when the Pirate Bay switched from .org to .se under threat of seizure by US law enforcement, which was followed by successive leaps to .gl, .is, .sx, .ac, .pe, .gy, and back to .se. Following that, the site shotgunned six domains at once, but after their .gs, .am, .gd, .mn, and .vg domains were under threat, they switched to the .se domain and added .ms. Now with the latter shut down and the former once again finding itself under threat, the Pirate Bay has returned to its .org roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shitty Batteries Just Got Shittier Thanks To Uber</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As if being stranded without a dying/dead phone isn&amp;rsquo;t already shitty enough (I&amp;rsquo;ve been there&amp;hellip; lost in the rain), Uber found a way to make the experience even shittier: by charging you more for it. Thanks to creepy analytics and insatiable greed, you can add &amp;ldquo;battery tax&amp;rdquo; to the list of things eating your paycheque.&lt;/p&gt;
