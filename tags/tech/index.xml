      <title>The Tracker Formerly Known AS thepiratebay.org Is Once Again thepiratebay.org</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet freedom trolls at the pirate bay have managed to close the loop in their border hopping fight to keep their tracker alive by once again returning to a temporary safe haven at thepiratebay.org, the domain their story started at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, this adventure started in 2012 when the Pirate Bay switched from .org to .se under threat of seizure by US law enforcement, which was followed by successive leaps to .gl, .is, .sx, .ac, .pe, .gy, and back to .se. Following that, the site shotgunned six domains at once, but after their .gs, .am, .gd, .mn, and .vg domains were under threat, they switched to the .se domain and added .ms. Now with the latter shut down and the former once again finding itself under threat, the Pirate Bay has returned to its .org roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shitty Batteries Just Got Shittier Thanks To Uber</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As if being stranded without a dying/dead phone isn&amp;rsquo;t already shitty enough (I&amp;rsquo;ve been there&amp;hellip; lost in the rain), Uber found a way to make the experience even shittier: by charging you more for it. Thanks to creepy analytics and insatiable greed, you can add &amp;ldquo;battery tax&amp;rdquo; to the list of things eating your paycheque.&lt;/p&gt;
