      <title>The Tracker Formerly Known AS thepiratebay.org Is Once Again thepiratebay.org</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet freedom trolls at the pirate bay have managed to close the loop in their border hopping fight to keep their tracker alive by once again returning to a temporary safe haven at thepiratebay.org, the domain their story started at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, this adventure started in 2012 when the Pirate Bay switched from .org to .se under threat of seizure by US law enforcement, which was followed by successive leaps to .gl, .is, .sx, .ac, .pe, .gy, and back to .se. Following that, the site shotgunned six domains at once, but after their .gs, .am, .gd, .mn, and .vg domains were under threat, they switched to the .se domain and added .ms. Now with the latter shut down and the former once again finding itself under threat, the Pirate Bay has returned to its .org roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As streaming music becomes the norm, YouTube has managed to scoop up enormous gains in its music traffic. In the music industry video streams surpassed audio streams growth of 82%, yet only increased revenues by 0.4% in the same time period. And they thought people downloading music was ripping them off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US Gets Rolling On Russian Tank Strategy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a move that looks anachronistic in the age of indiscriminate drone strikes, US is prepping to rethink its tank strategy in the face of Russian build up of their land units. While being prepared is one thing, lets hope the Pentagon remembers the golden rule: never get involved in a land war in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soon Robot Transports Won&#39;t Honk Back When You Pull The Air Horn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an entirely unsurprising bit of news, the march toward automated distribution moves forward. Startup Otto is making self driving transports, adding to the list of potential disruptors in the shipping space which already includes Amazon&amp;rsquo;s drone delivery system and the &amp;ldquo;Uber for trucking&amp;rdquo; service &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/centurylink/2016/02/23/how-uber-for-trucking-apps-are-driving-change-in-the-freight-industry/#72a7a05f6289&#34;&gt;Freight&lt;/a&gt;. So long convoys, hello unemployment lines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shitty Batteries Just Got Shittier Thanks To Uber</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As if being stranded without a dying/dead phone isn&amp;rsquo;t already shitty enough (I&amp;rsquo;ve been there&amp;hellip; lost in the rain), Uber found a way to make the experience even shittier: by charging you more for it. Thanks to creepy analytics and insatiable greed, you can add &amp;ldquo;battery tax&amp;rdquo; to the list of things eating your paycheque.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US Rejects Russia&#39;s Prom Date In Syria: Does Not Collaborate Or Coordinate With The Russians On Any Operations in Syria</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After proposing joint force strikes in Syria on Friday, Russia has been promptly shut down by the US. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis made clear that the US does &amp;ldquo;not collaborate or coordinate with the Russians on any operations in Syria&amp;rdquo;, going on to point out Russia&amp;rsquo;s support of Assad. In the end, nothing changes. Syria&amp;rsquo;s still rekt and remains the backdrop of a proxy war.&lt;/p&gt;
