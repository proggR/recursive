      <title>Elon Musk Is Gloating Over Higher Than Expected Shipment Numbers</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve said the investors are missing the forest for the trees by getting pissy about it. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watched Musk over the years has seen he has a larger vision in mind, and the Solar City acquisition positions Tesla closer to that goal than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only I&amp;rsquo;d put my money where my mouth is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect we&amp;rsquo;ll see news of a larger charging station rollout, a bigger push into residential solar/battery installations, Solar City&amp;rsquo;s role in both of those, and perhaps an update on the Gigafactory and its ability to transform the already quickly changing battery market. Put together, Tesla would be positioned to play an incredibly powerful role in the transition to a green energy grid through a decentralized energy production and distribution system that relies heavily on energy arbitrage. The real clincher would be if stronger state partnerships have been worked out and an announcement of Tesla pursuing closer relationships with more states as a way to secure tax credits for consumers adopting Tesla/other green energy tech that fits with this model. Investors only ever see the short term dollars and cents after all, but I suspect the master plan will be grand indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a fair chunk of that right too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that. I&amp;rsquo;m back. For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After catching flak for wanting to buy Solar City with Tesla money, Elon Musk claims to have a top secret Tesla master plan he hopes to release soon. Since news broke up the Solar City acquisition and the investor blowback, I&amp;rsquo;ve said the investors are missing the forest for the trees by getting pissy about it. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watched Musk over the years has seen he has a larger vision in mind, and the Solar City acquisition positions Tesla closer to that goal than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lithium Is One Helluva Drug... Err... Fire Starter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the missing EgyptAir plane, Capt John Cox explains that lithium batteries pose an increasing risk for airlines. Estimates show that aboard a plane of 100 passengers, there could be over 500 lithium batteries stowed away in the cabin. While unlikely, these lithium batteries could potentially cause a fire if they were to become punctured or otherwise damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the millions of reasons we desperately need solid state battery tech.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tracker Formerly Known AS thepiratebay.org Is Once Again thepiratebay.org</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet freedom trolls at the pirate bay have managed to close the loop in their border hopping fight to keep their tracker alive by once again returning to a temporary safe haven at thepiratebay.org, the domain their story started at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, this adventure started in 2012 when the Pirate Bay switched from .org to .se under threat of seizure by US law enforcement, which was followed by successive leaps to .gl, .is, .sx, .ac, .pe, .gy, and back to .se. Following that, the site shotgunned six domains at once, but after their .gs, .am, .gd, .mn, and .vg domains were under threat, they switched to the .se domain and added .ms. Now with the latter shut down and the former once again finding itself under threat, the Pirate Bay has returned to its .org roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As streaming music becomes the norm, YouTube has managed to scoop up enormous gains in its music traffic. In the music industry video streams surpassed audio streams growth of 82%, yet only increased revenues by 0.4% in the same time period. And they thought people downloading music was ripping them off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a move that looks anachronistic in the age of indiscriminate drone strikes, US is prepping to rethink its tank strategy in the face of Russian build up of their land units. While being prepared is one thing, lets hope the Pentagon remembers the golden rule: never get involved in a land war in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shitty Batteries Just Got Shittier Thanks To Uber</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As if being stranded without a dying/dead phone isn&amp;rsquo;t already shitty enough (I&amp;rsquo;ve been there&amp;hellip; lost in the rain), Uber found a way to make the experience even shittier: by charging you more for it. Thanks to creepy analytics and insatiable greed, you can add &amp;ldquo;battery tax&amp;rdquo; to the list of things eating your paycheque.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After proposing joint force strikes in Syria on Friday, Russia has been promptly shut down by the US. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis made clear that the US does &amp;ldquo;not collaborate or coordinate with the Russians on any operations in Syria&amp;rdquo;, going on to point out Russia&amp;rsquo;s support of Assad. In the end, nothing changes. Syria&amp;rsquo;s still rekt and remains the backdrop of a proxy war.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>sourced.fm: Restructuring the Music Industry With Community Driven Social Capitalism</title>
      <link>http://recursivew.it/projects/sourced-fm/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2016 21:24:53 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://recursivew.it/projects/sourced-fm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video may have killed the radio star, but industrial money killed music. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t its first time doing it. My fear is that unless we rally behind something better, its not going to be the last either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is the aristocracy has always found its ways to co-opt music for commoditized profits and influence. Throughout the renaissance era this came through the patronage model as patrons sought to influence culture by playing patron to the arts, primarily in pursuit of increased esteem among peers in a time when culture was associated with class. Throughout history this same model has been employed by the church to use music as a tool in their oppressive brainwashing of the masses. In more recent times, we know this aristocracy as the industrial label model of music through which big moneyed interests invest in and commoditize music primarily to increase profits. In all these forms of bought out music, music is secondary to another primary driving force. And for good reason; music is innately secondary to its primary driving force because music is primarily an emotional language. This is what makes it such a powerful tool for shaping group thought, and why its been consistently exploited by those with influence to increase and maintain their influence throughout our history. Its also why its time we take it back. Without music of and for the commons, we can&amp;rsquo;t share &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; messages, only consume the messages produced for us. The more stifled music is, the more stifled we all are by extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the industrial label model of music, music is treated as a mass producible consumer good, and labels insert themselves into the equation as if they were any other company manufacturing and selling goods in any industry. The primary driving force in this model is the profits created from sale of their commodity, in this case music. The issue with this arises when one asks &amp;ldquo;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Music?&amp;rdquo; After thoughtful introspective examination I think this question will lead many to be within the ballpark that music is primarily an emotional language. If this is the case, by treating music as a mass producible good, the result is that the messages this emotional language get used for will serve to prop up the culture of the status quo that has benefited the moneyed interests at the expense of the messages of those who the system harms. Because of music&amp;rsquo;s enormous influence on the culture and society its made for, this communication inequality serves as an enormous driver of socio-economic and cultural bubbles that burst more violently than they would if the channels of communication were flatter and more open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, the &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; is that communication inequality created by our commoditized, profit driven industrial music model amplifies socio-economic bubbles by silencing the underclass and propping up the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now many might not see music as quite as big a deal as I do in relation with our state of socio-economic and political affairs, but if we can agree that music plays a &lt;em&gt;noticably large&lt;/em&gt; role in influencing our culture and that the industrial label model of music is at the very least &lt;em&gt;a little predatory, self serving, profit driven, and flawed&lt;/em&gt;, I think its enough common ground to establish a new paradigm for serving music that functions better, even if we differ on the magnitude of indirect changes this transition will lead to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circling back to what music is, if it is in fact an emotional language then we have to ask ourselves, what should that language be used to say? If we have a tool that can express our ideas and feelings more deeply than anything written or spoke, how &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; it be used and toward &lt;em&gt;what ends&lt;/em&gt; should it aim its sights? While I would never suggest that musicians &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; use music to adopt a common purpose, as doing so would subvert music&amp;rsquo;s purpose in the same way labels have, I would suggest that if lensed through the idea that we suffer from communication inequality between the commons and the moneyed interests, for right now music&amp;rsquo;s end should ideally be to close that gap and do it by sharing the musician and their community&amp;rsquo;s world through their music. Musicians of the future need not concern themselves with chasing commercial trends, or boasting about swag or fetishized objects, but should instead seek to return to the roots of what music is, and use it to give a voice to the voiceless, to laud the under-appreciated laudable things, and to rebuke the anachronistic cultural artifacts that its time we shed. Music is what we make it, and I believe its time to make it as an organic bottom up community rather than a top down hierarchy peddling consumer fetishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[To be continued&amp;hellip;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first of many posts I will make exploring the reasons and motivations for &lt;a href=&#34;http://sourced.fm&#34;&gt;sourced.fm&lt;/a&gt;, an ethereal project with the enormous ambitions of restructuring the music industry. The goal of the project is to find a way to restructure its industry in a way that re-focuses music on its core relationship between creator and listener as opposed to the creator-label-everybodyelse model we rely on now. In this new model, all other actors are secondary to these core two, and as we&amp;rsquo;ll establish, by focusing the core of the industry on the creators and listeners, it becomes possible to establish a self sufficient model of music support that operates more efficiently than the one we&amp;rsquo;re used to. Through these efficiencies and focus on decentralizing and democratizing music, this model flattens the channels of communication, and by extension success. In this new model, profit is removed as a driving force by building atop a non-profit organization. In this new model, the communication of ideas through music is the primary driving force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sourced.fm&lt;/strong&gt; aims to make music by the commons, for the commons a viable path for musicians to pursue without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Am I Here?</title>
      <link>http://recursivew.it/meta/why-am-i-here/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2016 03:00:11 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://recursivew.it/meta/why-am-i-here/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why are any of us here? Its a bit like asking what the meaning of life is. Maybe in the end its as meaningless a question, but I think its an important idea that many people will consider at many points in their life. Why do we exist? For what purpose to we consume our environment, create waste, and eventually die? Or is the truth that there is no purpose and all this time thinking about it is ultimately a frivolous waste of the little time we&amp;rsquo;re certainly uncertain we have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. All of it, and none of it, at once and never. The truth is we know nothing about the world that we haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced, whether corporeally or through reason or empathy, and that while some people&amp;rsquo;s experiences will overlap with a great many others, most experiences are unique in nature and in the end come to represent different worlds. Not just different perspectives of one world, but entirely distinct worlds. While our purpose within the macro, objective world may indeed be, and in fact likely is, completely meaningless and irrelevant, our purpose within our own world becomes one of the most important questions for people to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the conundrum of the ontological self. The self is what it thinks of its world. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to be anything but that, because its world is simply the aggregate of its unique experiences which inserts the self into the very core of its world. There is indeed a world beyond that of the self, but as an embedded actor in that world, the world of the self is no less real than its macro reality because its not actually distinct from it, but rather an active part of the macro evolution of our shared world. In that sense, while most daily actions may be driven by a robotic self interest determined by our world, ignorant of the many worlds floating around ones own, to ask &amp;ldquo;Why am I here?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;What is my purpose?&amp;rdquo; in the end is to instead acknowledge these many worlds and assess ones place among them. Its a question that stops to ponder the existence of other worlds, even if only other versions of our own, and in doing so forces us to think of those worlds as being less distinct from one another than we tend to. While searching for an objective meaning of life is an exercise in folly, searching for meaning in ones own life helps the self come to a sense of equilibrium with its environment as its driven to close the gaps between the ideal and the reality of its world. Or put another way, to ask the subjective question &amp;ldquo;Why Am I Here?&amp;rdquo; is to aim at reducing the barriers between the world of the self and the many worlds it interacts with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This crappy piece of the internet isn&amp;rsquo;t all that different, if any of that made enough sense to make a comparison from. This site ultimately serves no purpose against the grand scales of the internet. It knows nothing of that broader web but the words and links that find its way onto it. To the internet, this site is as meaningless as we are to the universe. However to this site, it has to ask the question &amp;ldquo;Why Am I Here?&amp;rdquo; because to not do so would be to relinquish itself to non-existence. It is here because it is here, and now its purpose is to parse its world and determine how to improve upon it. It is here to ponder the barriers between it and the many other worlds on the internet, shaping its shared world and being shaped by it at once. It is here to discover, create, and communicate. It is here for the same reasons we are. None. And all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
